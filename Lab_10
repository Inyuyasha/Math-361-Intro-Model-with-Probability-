Tutorial

In this lab, you will use R to compute probabilities from the normal and t distributions and use what you've learned about linear combinations of normal random variables.

You will use the functions pt() and qt() to find probabilities and cutoff values from the t-distribution. These functions are analogous to the p___() and q___() functions you have used from other distributions. The t-distribution requires one parameter - the degrees of freedom; in R this argument is called df. You can pull up the help page for the t-distribution functions by typing ?pt() into your console.

Example 1

Find $P(44.4 \leq \overline{X} \leq 48.98)$ when $\overline{X}$ is the sample mean of $n = 16$ observations with $X \sim N(46.58,40.96)$

This implies $\overline{X} \sim N(46.58, 40.96/16)$

{r}
pnorm(48.98, mean = 46.58, sd = sqrt(40.96/16)) - pnorm(44.42, mean = 46.58, sd = sqrt(40.96/16))

Example 2

Find $t_{0.10}(34)$. This asks, what cutoff value gives 0.10 probability in the upper tail for a t-distribution with 34 degrees of freedom. Recall that functions starting with q allow us to find cutoff values for a given probability.

{r}
qt(p = 0.1, df = 34, lower.tail = FALSE)

Example 3

Find $P(âˆ’1.87 \leq T \leq 1.87)$ when $T \sim t(34)$

{r}
pt(1.87, df = 34) - pt(-1.87, df = 34)

Tasks

Task 1

Let $X_1, X_2, ... X_{16}$ be a random sample from a normal distribution $N(77,25)$. Compute the following. Hint: you should first determine how $\overline{X}$ is distributed

$P(77 \leq \overline{X} \leq 79.5)$

$P(74.2 \leq \overline{X} \leq 78.4)$

{r}
x <- pnorm(79.5, mean = 77, sd = sqrt(25)) - pnorm(77, mean = 77, sd = sqrt(25))

y <- pnorm(78.4, mean = 77, sd = sqrt(25)) - pnorm(74.2, mean = 77, sd = sqrt(25))

print(paste("The answer for part a is",x))
print(paste("The answer for part b is",y))

Task 2

Find the 95th percentile for the standard normal distribution. Compare it to the 95th percentile for the t-distribution with df = 10, df = 1000, and df = 100,000.

{r}
#95th percentile of standard normal
n_95 <- qnorm(0.95)

#95th percentile of t(10)
t_95_df10 <- qt(0.95, df = 10)

#95th percentile of t(1000)
t_95_df1000 <- qt(0.95, df = 1000)

#95th percentile of t(100000)
t_95_df100000 <- qt(0.95, df = 10000)

cat("95th Percentiles:\n")
cat("Standard Normal (Z):", round(n_95, 4), "\n")
cat("t-distribution (df = 10):", round(t_95_df10, 4), "\n")
cat("t-distribution (df = 1000):", round(t_95_df1000, 4), "\n")
cat("t-distribution (df = 100000):", round(t_95_df100000, 4), "\n")

Which of these four distribution has the "fattest tails"?

The "fattest tails" would be the t-distribution of (10) = 1.8125

Which two distributions are the most similar to one another?

The two distributions that are most similar to each other would be t-distribution of (1000) and t-distribution of (10000). The first distribution outputs 1.6464 and the second outputs 1.645.

Task 3

Find $P(-2.06 < X < 2.06)$ when $X \sim t(25)$

{r}
pt(2.06, df = 25) - pt(-2.06, df = 25)

Task 4

[HTZ 5.5-15, on group work]

Let the distribution of $T$ be $t(17)$. Find:

$t_{0.01}(17)$

$t_{0.95}(17)$

$P(-1.74 < T < 1.74)$

{r}
qt(0.01, df = 17)

qt(0.95, df = 17)

pt(1.74, df = 17) - pt(-1.74, df = 17)
