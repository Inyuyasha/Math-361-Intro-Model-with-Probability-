Tutorial

In this lab, you will practice simulating random variables from various distributions and estimating their means and variances.

Recall an example from lecture. Let $X$ have the pdf $f(x) = 4x^3 , \ \ \ 0 < x < 1$. If we want to simulate values from this distribution, we can find the cdf $Y = F(x)$ and its inverse $X = F^{-1}(y)$. We then utilize the fact that a cdf always follows a uniform (0,1) distribution.

Note $f(x) = 4x^3 \implies Y =F(x) = \int_0^x4t^3dt=x^4$. Therefore, $F^{-1}(y) = X = Y^{1/4}$. So we can simulate values of $X$ by first simulating $Y$ values from the uniform distribution, and then using $F^{-1}(Y)$ to obtain values of $X$.

{r}
#| message: false
#simulate 100,000 y values from the uniform distribution
y <- runif(100000)

#use the inverse cdf to compute x
x <- y^{1/4}

#plot a histogram of the random variable x
ggplot() +
   geom_histogram(aes(x = x), 
                  color = "white", boundary = 1) +
   theme_minimal()

Mathematically, we can find the mean and the variance of $X$ as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= \int_0^1xf(x)dx \\
&= \int_0^1x4x^3dx \\
&= \int_0^14x^4dx \\
&= \frac{4}{5}x^5 \rvert_0^1 \\
&= \frac{4}{5}
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
V(X) &= E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\
&= \int_0^1x^2f(x)dx - \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]^2\\
&= \int_0^1x^24x^3dx - \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]^2\\
&= \int_0^14x^5dx - \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]^2\\
&= \frac{4}{6}x^6 \rvert_0^1 - \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]^2\\
&= \frac{4}{6} - \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]^2 \\
&= \frac{2}{125} = 0.02\overline{666}
\end{aligned}$$

We can check our work by computing the mean and variance of our simulate values in R. The built-in R functions are mean() and var(). Because these are simulated values, the mean and variance will not match exactly, but should be very close.

var(x)

Tasks

Task 1

Simulate 100,000 values from the Cauchy distribution and plot a histogram of the distribution. Refer to your Chapter 5 Group Work. Recall that the cdf of a Cauchy distribution is $$F = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(arctan(x) + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \ \ \ -\infty < x < \infty$$ Hint: in R, the function tan() computes the tangent, and R recognizes the object pi

{r}
#simulate y from the uniform distribution
y <- runif(100000)

#compute x using the inverse
x <- tan(pi * (y - 0.5))

#plot histogram of x
ggplot() +
   geom_histogram(aes(x = x), 
                  color = "white", boundary = 1) +
   theme_minimal()

Task 2

Perform a simulation to estimate $Cov(V, W)$, where $V = X + Y$, $W = max(X, Y)$, and $X$, $Y$ are both distributed as $N(100, 15)$. To do this,

Simulate 100,000 x-values using the rnorm() function. Recall that the rnorm() function requires that you specify sd, the standard deviation, not the variance. Run ?rnorm in your console to pull up the help page.

Simulate 100,000 y-values using the rnorm() function

Create new objects v and w from the simulated x and y values. Note that the function pmax() will compute the pair-wise maximums for two vectors.

Use the function cov() to compute the covariance between v and w

{r}
#simulate 100,000 x-values
x <- rnorm(100000, mean = 100, sd = 15)

#simulate 100,000 y-values
y <- rnorm(100000, mean = 100, sd = 15)


#create v
v <- x + y


#create w
w <- pmax(x, y)



#compute covariance 
cov_vw <- cov(v, w)

print(cov_vw)

Task 3

Use R to compute the mean and variance of your simulated x and y values from Task 2. What do you expect these values to equal based on how $X$ and $Y$ are distributed? Are they good estimates of $E(X)$, $V(X)$, $E(Y)$, and $V(Y)$?

{r}
#mean of x
mean_x <- mean(x)

#variance of x
var_x <- var(x)

#mean of y
mean_y <- mean(y)

#variance of y
var_y <- var(y)

print(paste("Mean of x:", mean_x, "\n"))
print(paste("Variance of x:", var_x, "\n"))
print(paste("Mean of y:", mean_y, "\n"))
print(paste("Variance of y:", var_y, "\n"))

I believe that the values for X and Y will be high numbers since the cov_vw = 255.4046. Comparing to the outputs in Task 3 I would say they are decent/good outputs because they fall within the range of 225. The mean of x is 100.020. The variance of x is 224. The mean of y is 100.080. The variance of y is 225.2160. This all falls within the parameters we are looking for.

Task 4

Exercise 5.1-6 on Homework 09 asks you to find the cdf of $X$ where $f(x) = 2x, 0 < x < 1$ and describe how you would simulate an observation of $X$. Using your work from parts a and b of that exercise, use R to:

simulate 100,000 values of $X$

plot a histogram

estimate the mean

estimate the variance

{r}
#simulate y
u <- runif(100000)


#simulate x
x <- sqrt(u)


#plot histogram
hist(x, breaks = 50, main = "Histogram of Simulated X", xlab = "X", col = "skyblue", border = "white")


#compute mean of x
mean_x <- mean(x)


#compute variance of x
var_x <- var(x)


print(paste("Estimated mean of X:", mean_x, "\n"))
print(paste("Estimated variance of X:", var_x, "\n"))
